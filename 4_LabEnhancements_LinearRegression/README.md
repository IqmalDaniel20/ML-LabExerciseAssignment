# Lab 7 Enhancement - Stress Level Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the Lab 7 Enhancement for a course on Machine Learning or Data Science, focusing on analyzing and predicting stress levels among university students using linear regression. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of a linear regression model.

## Objectives

- To understand the correlation between age and reported stress levels among university students.
- To apply a linear regression model to predict stress levels based on age.
- To interpret the results and provide insights into the potential stress factors affecting university students.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualization of stress levels across different age groups.
- Statistical summary of the data to understand distributions and outliers.

## Model Implementation

- **Linear Regression Analysis**:
  - Fit a linear regression model to predict stress levels based on student age.
  - Evaluation of the model's performance using the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).

## Results and Discussion

- Interpretation of the linear regression model's coefficients.
- Discussion on how age impacts stress levels among university students, with visual and statistical evidence from the model.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings of the analysis, discuss the limitations of the current model, and suggest areas for further research or improvement.

## Installation and Execution

To interact with the analysis:
1. **Open Google Colab**: Visit [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. **Import the Notebook**: Click on `File` > `Upload notebook` > `Choose file` to upload the `.ipynb` file.
3. **Upload the Dataset**:
   - Navigate to the sidebar, select the `Files` tab, and click on `Upload to session storage`.
   - Drag and drop the `Student Mental health.csv` file into the Colab session storage.
4. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the code cells sequentially to explore the analysis and model training steps.
