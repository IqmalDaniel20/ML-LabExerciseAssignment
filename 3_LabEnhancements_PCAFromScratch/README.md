# PCA Lab Enhancement from Scratch

## Overview

This repository contains a detailed enhancement of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) lab designed to deepen the understanding of PCA by implementing it from scratch. The lab explores the mathematical foundations, practical implementations, and applications to real-world datasets such as the Iris dataset.

## Objectives

- **Mathematical Understanding**: Break down the mathematical steps involved in PCA, including covariance matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition.
- **Practical Implementation**: Demonstrate how to implement PCA from scratch in Python.
- **Dataset Application**: Apply the PCA technique to the Iris dataset and visualize the results.
- **Interactive Learning**: Utilize interactive widgets in Google Colab to dynamically adjust the number of principal components and observe the impact on variance explained.

## Content Description

- **Introduction to PCA**: Overview of PCA and its significance in data analysis.
- **Mathematical Derivation of PCA**: Detailed steps including standardizing the dataset, computing the covariance matrix, eigenvalue decomposition, and selecting principal components.
- **PCA Implementation from Scratch**: Python code that walks through each step of PCA implementation using NumPy.
- **Real-World Dataset Application**: Application of PCA on the Iris dataset including data visualization before and after PCA transformation.
- **Variance Explained Calculation**: Explanation of how much variance each principal component accounts for.
- **Interactive Widgets**: A feature in Google Colab to allow users to experiment with the number of principal components.

## Installation and Execution

To run the PCA enhancement lab:

1. **Open Google Colab**: Navigate to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. **Import the Notebook**: Use the `File` > `Upload notebook` option to upload the `.ipynb` file provided in this repository.
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells sequentially to understand each step of PCA from scratch.
